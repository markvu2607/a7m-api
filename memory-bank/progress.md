# A7M API - Progress

## What Works

Based on the initial review of the codebase, the following features appear to be implemented:

- Core NestJS application structure
- Module organization for main features
- Authentication system with JWT
- User management
- Problem definition and management
- Solution management
- Submission handling
- Tag system for categorization
- S3 integration for file storage
- Email service integration

## What's In Progress

Without deeper code analysis, it's difficult to determine what's actively in progress, but the coding module appears to be a recent addition and may be under active development.

## What's Left To Build

Without detailed requirements, it's challenging to identify specific missing features. However, common features for a coding platform that might need implementation:

- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Analytics and statistics
- Leaderboards or rankings
- Batch operations for administrators
- Integration with additional external services
- Enhanced notification systems
- Performance optimizations for scaling

## Known Issues

No specific issues have been identified yet. Future updates to this document will track known bugs, technical debt, and limitations.

## Current Status Summary

The A7M API appears to be a functional NestJS backend for a coding platform with core features implemented. More detailed analysis is needed to determine the completeness and quality of individual modules.

## Next Milestone

As this is the initial memory bank creation, specific milestones are not yet documented. Future updates will track upcoming milestones and their criteria.

## Testing Status

The project has Jest configured for both unit and E2E testing. A more detailed review of test coverage is needed to assess the testing status accurately.

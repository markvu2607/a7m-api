# A7M API - Active Context

## Current Focus

The A7M API project appears to be a NestJS-based backend for a coding platform or online judge system. Based on the directory structure and package dependencies, the system seems to be under active development with core modules for problems, solutions, submissions, users, and authentication already in place.

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial memory bank creation, specific recent changes are not yet documented. Future updates to this file will track significant changes to the codebase.

## Current State

The project has several key modules implemented:

- Authentication system with JWT
- User management
- Problems management
- Solutions management
- Submissions processing
- Tag system for categorization
- S3 integration for file storage
- Email service integration
- A coding module that likely handles code execution or evaluation

## Active Decisions

As this is the initial memory bank creation, specific active decisions are not yet documented. Future updates will track key decision points and their rationales.

## Next Steps

Initial proposed next steps (to be refined based on actual priorities):

1. Review the codebase in more detail to understand implementation details
2. Identify any missing features or incomplete modules
3. Evaluate test coverage and identify areas needing additional tests
4. Document API endpoints and their purposes
5. Review error handling and validation mechanisms

## Open Questions

- What is the current deployment strategy?
- How is code execution/judging implemented?
- What is the authentication flow in detail?
- Are there any performance bottlenecks identified?
- What is the state of the front-end application that consumes this API?

## Current Challenges

As this is the initial memory bank creation, specific current challenges are not yet documented. Future updates will track challenges faced and their potential solutions.
